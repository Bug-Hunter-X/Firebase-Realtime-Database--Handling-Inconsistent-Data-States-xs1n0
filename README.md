# Firebase Realtime Database: Handling Inconsistent Data States

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase Realtime Database related to inconsistent data states due to race conditions and network issues. The error manifests intermittently, making it challenging to debug.

## Bug Description
The application uses Firebase Realtime Database to manage application state. In scenarios involving concurrent updates or network instability, data can become inconsistent leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm start`
4. Observe the intermittent errors related to data inconsistency.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing robust error handling and data synchronization mechanisms such as optimistic updates and transactions to ensure data consistency. The `databaseSolution.js` file demonstrates the improved implementation with error handling and transactions.
